4. **Sentiment Analysis**: "We analyze message sentiment - positive, negative, or neutral - to gauge market sentiment."

5. **Hype Score Calculation**: "We calculate a hype score based on mention count, pump signals, and coordination patterns."

6. **Risk Assessment**: "This social media data feeds into our risk assessment model to identify potentially manipulated stocks."
